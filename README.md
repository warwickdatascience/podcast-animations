## About

This repository contains the scripts used to generate the background animations for the Warwick Data Science Society podcast DataBasic. 

## Usage

We advise using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install the dependencies of this repository. To do this, clone the repository and create a new environment from the cloned directory with

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create an environment called `wdss-animation-env` which can be activated with

```
conda activate wdss-animation-env
```

Once this environment is active, you will be able to run any scripts after configuring any parameters.
