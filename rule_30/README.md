## About

[Rule 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30) is a cellular automaton envisioned by Stephen Wolfram (of WolframAlpha/Mathematica fame). In our implementation we expand the state from its standard binary implementation to have different statuses for all alive cells based on the sub-rule that gave rise to them.
